### What to Expect?

We use wedded high quality questions for hackathon which are challenging but in a good way. These questions / problem statements are important to showcase your skills for the actual hackathon. The problem statements will be given at the time of hackathon or pre-released a few hours prior.

Teams are not restricted to a particular college, you can plan a reunion with all your friends from different colleges also.

Only shortlisted teams will qualify for the on-site (physical) hackathon.

To ensure participants have a seamless experience, facilities like accommodation, food, and technical arrangements will be provided.

These will require a nominal additional fee, which will be communicated and collected through follow-up emails after qualification.
