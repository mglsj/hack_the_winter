# Rules

- Internet usage is allowed for references, but plagiarism leads to disqualification.
- A.I. agents usages is prohibited.
- All work must be original and completed during the hackathon timeframe.
- Teams must adhere to the provided theme.
- The decision of the judges will be final and binding.
- Misconduct, inappropriate behavior, or rule violations will result in disqualification.
- Teams cannot change members once registration closes.
- All shortlisted teams must attend the physical hackathon in person.
- No judgement in UI/UX part, so rather than code we focus on concept, research and basic implementation.

## Judging Criteria:

To ensure fairness and transparency, project evaluations will take place every 6 - 10 hours throughout the hackathon. Each team's progress, creativity, and implementation will be continuously assessed and displayed live on the public leaderboard, allowing participants to track their standing in real time.

After the hackathon concludes, a final evaluation will be conducted by three specialized judging panels, each focusing on different domains such as technology, innovation, design, and business impact. These panels will consist of industry experts, professors, and experienced developers who will evaluate every project holistically.

## Evaluation Criteria:

Each project will be scored out of 100 points based on the following criteria:

###### Innovation and Creativity (25%)

Originality of the idea, uniqueness of the approach, and how creatively the problem has been solved. Judges will look for out-of-the-box thinking and new perspectives on existing challenges.
###### Technical Implementation (25%)

Depth and quality of the technical work — including code quality, architecture, functionality, and the technologies used. Teams should demonstrate solid technical execution and problem-solving skills.

###### Feasibility and Scalability (20%)

Practicality of the solution and its potential to scale in real-world environments. Judges will assess how realistic the idea is and how easily it could be expanded or deployed.

###### Design and Usability (15%)

User interface, experience, and overall design clarity. The product should be intuitive, accessible, and visually appealing, offering a seamless experience to users.

###### Presentation and Impact (15%)

How effectively the team communicates their solution, its potential social or business impact, and the clarity of their final pitch or demo.
